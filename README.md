# Complete University Guide Web Scraper and Analysis using R

## Background
A web scraper project for the assignment of Web and Network Analytics (IST2334) on scrapping and analysing the Complete University Guide - a site that provides the top-ranked United Kingdom league universities for the year 2022 [[link](https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings?tabletype=full-table)] using R.

### Problem Statement
The research questions to be addressed are:
1. Which Universities spend the most on resources?
2. Does a university with high academic spendings result in high students satisfaction with the quality of education they receive? 
3. Does a university with a high overall score have a high entry standard as well?
4. Does the graduate prospects on track translate to graduate prospects outcome well and what role do they play in the ranking of the university?
5. Does a university with high entry standards translate to more students completing their course?
